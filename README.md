# Ashipka

The website was created to work with backlinks.

## Static website

Website was deployed to github pages and available on [Github page by link](https://pinkyrabbit.github.io/ashipka).

To do this I have a `yml` config in `.github` directory. To make static files available I set a `homepage` property in `package.json`.

## React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). There are default `React` scripts to run and build.
